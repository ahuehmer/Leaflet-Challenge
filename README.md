# **Leaflet-Challenge**

The leaflet challenge consisted of creating a map showing and providing information on recent earthquakes on a global scale.
The earthquake data was gathered from the USGS website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/). The specific dataset used, provides information about earthquakes that occured in the past seven days.

Earthquakes are plotted on the map based on their longitude and latitude and depicted as a circle. A larger magnitude is reflected in a larger radius of the circles. The deeper the earthquake, the darker the fill color of the circle marker. Each marker also has a popup providing information on the location, time, depth, and magnitude of each earthquake.
